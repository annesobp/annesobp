### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ :revolving_hearts: 
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing on a DevOps course on Udemy.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS (the basics)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a new project that I will find inspiring! (Python)
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with just learning how to code in general. I would like to build cool things! 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about recruitment, I do some headhunting for a living, but it will change soon enough.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak French, English and Korean.
